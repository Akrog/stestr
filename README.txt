Test Repository
+++++++++++++++

Overview
~~~~~~~~

This project provides a database of test results which can be used as part of
developer workflow to ensure/check things like:
 * No commits without having had a test failure, test fixed cycle.
 * No commits without new tests being added.
 * What tests have failed since the last commit (to run just a subset).
